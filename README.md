** Timing Problem **

the "now" only take time stamp in seconds, so it will be time offset in month. To solve it, a function
can take a 12 elements of array which stands for each day of month, and than multiply the seconds in
day. I found it is possible but very complicated, the best way is just to have oracle to set the time.

** Except those, it is all good ! **
